      <h1>Body Mass Index Calculator</h1>

      <p>
        Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our body
        mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant of a
        healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate your
        overall health and well-being.

      <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>

      <p>
        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
        Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
        health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a
        nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample
        fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical
        activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

      <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>

      <p>
        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not
        suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their
        BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be
        beneficial to use.
      </p>

        alt="a icon with both gender symbols combined into one"
      />
      <h4>Gender</h4>
      <p>
        The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with
        age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
        evaluating their BMI.
      </p>

      <img
        src="./assets/images/icon-age.svg"
        alt="an icon of a birthday cake"
      />
      <h4>Age</h4>
      <p>
        In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI
        to underestimate body fat content.
      </p>

      <img
        src="./assets/images/icon-muscle.svg"
        alt="an icon of a muscular arm"
      />
      <h4>Muscle</h4>
      <p>
        BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it
        doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.
      </p>

      <img
        src="./assets/images/icon-pregnancy.svg"
        alt="an icon of a baby face"
      />
      <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
      <p>
        Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby.
        Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health
        risks for both mother and child.
      </p>

      <img
        src="./assets/images/icon-race.svg"
        alt="an icon of a human body"
      />
      <h4>Race</h4>
      <p>
        Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian
        origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to
        discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
